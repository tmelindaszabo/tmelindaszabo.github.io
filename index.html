            <h2>Molecular bionics engineer</h2>
            <p>My passion is learning. I have studied as a molecular bionics engineer at Pázmány Péter Catholic University. I always wanted to be a researcher, but I changed my mind. Last summer I decided to choose something else and I started to learn programming by myself.
                <br><br><br> After a summer internship program I realized my knowledge misses the basics. I hope with this course I will become an excellent software developer.
